*DESCRIPTION*:

In this project, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather forecast data for the Ahmedabad city and created visualizations using Python libraries—specifically Matplotlib and Seaborn. The development environment used for this task was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provided a clean and efficient platform to write, debug, and execute the code.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED: 
1. PYTHON: Python was the main programming language used for this task. It is well-suited for data handling, API interaction, and visualization due to its simplicity and large ecosystem of libraries.
2. REQUESTS LIBRARY: The requests library in Python was used to send HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with APIs and handle JSON responses with ease.
3. OPENWEATHERMAP API: OpenWeatherMap provides free and premium weather data APIs. In this task, I used the 5-day weather forecast API, which returns data at 3-hour intervals. The API requires a free API key and supports queries by city name.
4. MATPLOTLIB: Matplotlib is a core plotting library in Python. It was used to create line plots to visualize the temperature trends over time.
5. SEABORN: Seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, was used to enhance the visual aesthetics of the plots. It simplifies styling and offers better-looking graphs with less code.
6. VISUAL STUDIO CODE(VS CODE): I used VS Code as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project. It supports Python development through the Python extension, providing features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, debugging tools, and terminal access—all in one place.

PROCESS:
The process started with installing the required libraries using pip: requests, matplotlib, and seaborn. Once the OpenWeatherMap API key was obtained by signing up on their website, I wrote Python code in VS Code to fetch the forecast data for a specific city. The JSON response was parsed to extract timestamps and temperature data. The data was then passed to Seaborn to create a line plot that displays temperature variations over a five-day period in 3-hour intervals.
The graph includes labeled axes, a title, grid lines, and timestamp formatting for better readability. This simple project demonstrated how multiple technologies can work together to transform raw data into informative visuals.

APPLICATIONS:
1. WEATHER MONITORING SYSTEMS
2. SMART AGRICULTURE
3. EDUCATION AND LEARNING
4. IoT AND SMART HOMES
5. NEWS AND MEDIA
6. ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
